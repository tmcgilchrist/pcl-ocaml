pcl - A parsec-style parser combinator library for ocaml

This directory contains the basic pcl code.  See the Parsec
documentation at (http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html).  See DOC
in this directory for pcl specific information and differences from
Parsec.  See INSTALL for directions on building, but currently the
build system is not very complicated, so you can probably just
type make and use the resulting pcl.cma file.


Subdirectories:

test - contains a test suite
examples - contains several examples, including a few calculators,
  an s-expression parser, and a (not yet totally complete) SML parser

For now, there isn't a fancy build system in place.

"make" or "make all" will build pcl.cma, which will have
the modules in this directory at the top level.

"make opt" builds pcl.cmxa

"make check" builds pcl.cma, some of the example parsers in
the "parsers" subdirectory, the test suite in the "test" subdirectory,
and runs the test suite.  You may want to send its output to a file.

This directory contains an SML parser.  It's basically complete, with
only a few small issues remaining.  This code deals only with the
parsing, and some of the syntactic restrictions mentioned outside of
the grammar itself.  I may write those eventually for completeness,
but the aren't here now.  The ast is a heavily modified version of the
one that ships with smlnj.

hw4_sol.sml is an sml file that I happened to have lying around (it's
the solutions to an assignment I wrote).  It uses a lot of the
grammar, and so it's an interesting test file for the parser if
you're looking for something to play around with.
